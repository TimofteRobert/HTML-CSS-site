        <h4 class="section-tips">The CPU is the brain of your computer. The more powerful the CPU, the faster your computer calculates. 
            At the same time you can have the best processor but if other parts of your pc are slow it won't help that much.</h4>
        <h4 class="section-tips">A good website to use if you want to buy a processor is this one: </h4>

        <h4 class="section-tips">As a tip, as of today for a gaming pc the majority of games use single core processing, 
            so it's better to look at single thread performance.</h4>
        <h4 class="section-tips">Meanwhile a workstation pc which is used by creators finds the multi-core performance of a CPU more important. </h4>
        <h4 class="section-tips">The most known ones are Intel and AMD, they don't fit the same motherboard, when you buy a motherboard
             you should see at the specification what type of CPU it supports because of the different connecting pins.</h4>

        <h4 class="section-tips">Intel CPU's short explanation using Inter Core 14900K as an example:
            <p></p>
            <p>Brand:</p>
            <p>* Intel Core - old but powerful</p>  
            <p>* Intel Core Ultra - latest model, focused on efficiency</p>
            <p>Model:</p>
            <img src="images/intel-models.jpg" alt="Intel models" width="25%">
            <p>Intel Core i3 - Entry level processors for lower-powered setups. Used in office or low tier products.</p>
            <p>Intel Core i5 - Performance-focus. Has at least 6 cores and are a good choice for a gaming pc. Has a higher cache capacity than i3.</p>
            <p>Intel Core i7 - Better than i5, preferred for streamers who usually stream while gaming. Good for video editing and has more cache than i5.</p>
            <p>Inter Core i9 - The best and most powerful CPU's from Intel. They have at least 12 cores.</p>
            <p>Generation:</p>
            <p>The numbers except the last 3 indicate the generation, ex: 14900 (generation 14)</p>
            <p>TDP Value:</p>
            <p>The K at the end shows the expected TDP value and it's form factor.</p>
            <p>K,X, XE are the CPU which are unlocked, being able to Overclock. HK, HX are the unlocked CPU's for laptops.</p>
            <p>Not having a letter at the end indicates a locked CPU. For laptops having the letter H at the end shows an locked CPU.</p>
            The letter 'F' indicates that the CPU cannot overclock and it's not capable of video output.
            <p>Having 'KF' shows a CPU that can overclock but has no video output.</p>
            <p>The letter 'T' and 'U' meant it's optimized for light tasks, they have integrated GPU's but no higher clock speed.
                These ones are for long battery life.</p>

        <h4 class="section-tips">AMD CPU's short explanation for the letters at the end:
            <p></p>
            <p>XTX - Represents the highest performance, the top tier product.</p>
            <p>XT - High performance, usually have higher clock speeds, more processing cores and other enhanced features.</p>
            <p>M - Used for mobile GPU's used in laptops or other mobile devices. Optimized for lower power consumption and thermal output.</p>
            <p>X - Has a slight performance boost compared to a base model.</p>
            <p>S - Stands for special edition or it is a variant with a specific feature.</p>
            <p>G - It is found in APU's(Accelerated Processing Units), indicating that they have integrated graphics.</p>
            <p>AMD models have similar models like intel.(Ryzen 3,5,7,9)</p>

            checking the compatibility. Not the best coolers of course but they usually are good enough.
             Of course if you want better you will have to buy another yourself. It's good to read reviews about the CPU and the cooler it comes with.</h4>
